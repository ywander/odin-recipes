        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Butter or oil for cooking</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. The batter should be slightly lumpy.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with butter or oil.</li>

        <li>Flip the pancakes and cook for another 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the skillet as needed.</li>
